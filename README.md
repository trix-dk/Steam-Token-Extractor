# Steam-Token-Extractor
 The perfect extension which copies your data-loyalty_webapi_token to your clipboard which you after can paste into csgoroll. For a more detailed guide read the README.md file


Here is a detailed guide on how to use the extension:

1. Download the file from github.
2. After downloading the file then unzip it. 
3. Go to chrome://extensions/ and make sure you have developer mode enabled (can be turned on/ off at top right corner.)
4. After that press the "Load unpacked" button at the top left.
5. After that find the unzipped version and upload it.
6. Go to any official steam page and press the "Copy" button, after you have done that the token value will then be copied to your clipboard and be ready to get pasted onto csgoroll


I would always reccomend having the extension pinned which makes it easier to accsess and use. 


!!Make sure not to share your token with anyone else!!
